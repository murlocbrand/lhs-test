     h2 1. Continually and actively improve ourselves as programmers
     div.manifesto.desc
       p
         | Accept what is, but do not be satisfied by it. Strive to improve your knowledge of 
         | your craft, to improve it through creating new things, doing research, collaborating, 
         | dissecting the code of others and in turn having yours dissected, taking part in 
         | discussions and generating them.

      h2 2. Create new things
      div.manifesto.desc
        p
          | There are too many people wasting time, effort and creative energy by reinventing 
          | the wheel. Strive instead to seek out the inventions of others, to learn how they 
          | work, to use them in order to create new things. The giants are already out there, 
          | all you have to do is go stand on their shoulders.

      h2 3. Show and share our creations and what we learned during the process of creating them
      div.manifesto.desc
       p
        | A thing is wasted if it isn’t shared. Actively discuss your creations with other 
        | people, exchange them,  give them away for free, sell them – anything but hoard them.

      h2 4. Facilitate human connections between programmers
      div.manifesto.desc
       p
        | Programming as an occupation, a calling and a hobby is far too solitary for the 
        | benefit of anyone. Actively connect with other programmers, with creators in other 
        | fields. Discuss and dissect the similarities and differences between your 
        | approaches, philosophies, lifestyles. Connect with others,  life is too short and 
        | precious to be an isolated island.
